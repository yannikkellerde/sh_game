# Secret Hitler in Python
Create Players by subclassing [Player](/player.py) and implement responses to all [Events](/types/event_types.py). A suitable [Manager](/manager.py) decides when it is who's turn to write a message, claim or when it is time to go on with the game actions. 

Run a game with baseline players via [run_test_game.py](/run_test_game.py)
